    "# 100A #1: Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "You have been learning R in the textbook using the *DataCamp* interface. But statisticians and data scientists don't use *DataCamp* in their work. They use either RStudio or Jupyter Notebooks. The main advantage of these platforms is that they enable you to save your work and continue it later.\n",
    "## 1. Jupyter Basics\n",
    "Here are a few basic concepts to get you started with Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "1. **A notebook is a page.** The page you are looking at right now is a single Jupyter Notebook. In some ways it is like any other document. But there is one important difference: if you write code on a Jupyter Notebook page the code can be run right on the page. And if you run the code, the output will be inserted on the page right below the code.\n",
    "2. **A notebook consists of a series of *cells*.** There are two main types of cells: a *markdown* cell, which is used for entering text; and a *code* cell, which is used for entering R code. (We have over-simplified a bit here, but this is enough to get you started.) The text you are reading now is inside of a *markdown* cell. A little further down the page we will show you some *code* cells.\n",
    "3. **A notebook is a great way to organize, present, and share a data analysis.** The notebook format fits well with the practice of data analysis. In a *markdown* cell you can pose questions and then propose a data analysis plan. You can then add a *code* cell to write R code and actually run the analyses you want to run. After you run an analysis, you can add another *markdown* cell to interpret the results of the anlysis you ran.\n"

    "## 2. Markdown Cells\n",
    "Now lets take a closer look at how *markdown* cells work. Here are some key points:\n",
    "1. Click on a cell (go ahead and click on this one). The blue bar on the left side shows that the cell is selected.\n",
    "2. Look at the dropdown menu on the far right side of the toolbar and you will see that it says **Markdown**. That's how you can tell for sure what kind of cell you have selected. (You also can use the dropdown to change one cell type to another.)\n",
    "3. When you double-click in a cell **(don't do it yet)**, it puts the cell in **edit** mode, and you can then modify the contents of the cell.\n",
    "4. When you are in edit mode the markdown text isn't as nicely formatted. Markdown is a way to enter plain text, and make it look nicely formatted when it is finally rendered in a page. \n",
    "5. To render a *markdown* cell when it is in **edit** mode you just need to **run** it. You can do this in a number of ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Click on the **Cell** menu (above the toolbar) and select **Run Cells**\n",
    "\n",
    "-Click on the **Run** button on the toolbar\n",
    "\n",
    "-Hit **Shift + Return**"

    "## 3. Edit a Markdown Cell\n",
    "Using just a few *markdown* conventions you can make your Jupyter Notebook look nice and organized. To add headings and subheadings you just put some # symbols at the beginning of a line. \n",
    "# First Level Headings\n",
    "To add a first level heading just put a single # symbol, then a space, before a line of text (as we did here). \n",
    "## Second Level Headings\n",
    "For these you put two ## followed by a space in front of a line of text, etc.\n",
    "### And here's a third level\n",
    "\n",
    "**Putting two asterisks in front of and at the end of some text makes the text bold.**\n",
    "*Putting a single asterisk in front of and at the end of some text makes it italics.*\n",

    "- Item 2\n",
    "- Item 3\n",

    "Note that you can also do some fancy stuff in Jupyter Notebooks, like show alert boxes in different colors. You don't need to worry about this, except to note that we will sometimes use color to make our notebooks easier to follow (like in the paragraph below).\n",
